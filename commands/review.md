description: "Review code using accumulated learnings"
---

Review the current code changes against accumulated learnings.

1. **Read ~/.claude/learnings/index.md** to load all patterns
2. **Check git diff** to see current changes
3. **Evaluate each change** against:
   - Universal patterns (timeouts, classification, data processing)
   - Technology-specific patterns
   - Code review checklist items from code-review.md

4. **Report findings:**
   - Patterns that were correctly applied
   - Patterns that should be applied but weren't
   - Potential new learnings to capture

Format as a code review with specific line references and actionable suggestions.
